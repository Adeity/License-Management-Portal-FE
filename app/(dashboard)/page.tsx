              The License Management Portal is a sophisticated web-based application developed as part of my diploma thesis work. This project leverages modern web technologies, including TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and npm, to create a robust and user-friendly platform for managing software licenses. The portal is designed to streamline the process of license allocation, tracking, and renewal, providing a comprehensive solution for organizations to efficiently manage their software assets. The application features a modular architecture, utilizing components from the Material-UI library and the Next.js framework to ensure a seamless user experience and maintainability. The License Management Portal aims to address the challenges associated with license management, offering a centralized system that enhances operational efficiency and compliance.
